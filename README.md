# My Shop ðŸ›’

A React Native-based, simple groceries shop. Here is a list of used libraries and technologies:

* **[Expostack](https://createexpostack.com/):** A really good app bootstrapper, which allows you to create advanced boilerplates with a few keyboard clicks.
* **[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest):** Quite powerful fetching and state management library. A good alternative to Redux when you do not need too much complexity.
* **[Tamagui UI](https://tamagui.dev/):** Modern, a bit "on hype" UI KIT. Fast and multiplatform.
* **[Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/):** File-based navigation. A good alternative to classic React Navigation.
* **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/):** Reliable and worldwide beloved testing framework.
* **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/):** Almost de facto standard, code formatting tool.
* **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/):** Also almost an industry standard for linting and code style.
